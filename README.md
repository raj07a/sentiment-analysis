**#Sentiment Analysis with LSTM**
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on airline tweets using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task where the sentiment expressed in a piece of text is classified into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Utilizes the Pandas library to load and preprocess the airline tweet dataset, including filtering out neutral sentiment tweets.
Text Tokenization: Implements text tokenization using the Keras Tokenizer class to convert text data into numerical sequences suitable for input to the LSTM model.
Model Architecture: Constructs an LSTM neural network using the TensorFlow Keras API, consisting of an embedding layer, LSTM layer, dropout layers, and a dense output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Training and Evaluation: Trains the LSTM model on the preprocessed tweet data, evaluates its performance using accuracy metrics, and visualizes training and validation accuracy and loss curves using Matplotlib.
Prediction: Provides a function to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of new text inputs using the trained LSTM model.
